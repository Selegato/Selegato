# Hello, I'm Paulo Selegato

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a Cloud Developer specialized in **AWS and Python**, with hands-on experience designing, building, and operating cloud-native and serverless solutions. My work covers the full lifecycle of cloud systems — from architecture design and infrastructure provisioning to service optimization and operational excellence.

I have a strong background in AWS, where I design scalable and secure architectures, evaluate technical and cost trade-offs, and modernize workloads using serverless and event-driven patterns. I am particularly focused on **efficiency, reliability, observability, and cost optimization**, including real-world initiatives that significantly reduced cloud operating costs.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer), AWS SAM, Infrastructure as Code  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: FastAPI, Flask, Django  
- **Monitoring & FinOps**: Metrics, dashboards, alarms, centralized logging, cost allocation via tagging  

## Areas of Focus

- AWS cloud architecture design and infrastructure provisioning  
- Development and optimization of Python-based cloud services  
- Serverless and event-driven architectures using AWS SAM  
- Cloud cost optimization and financial governance (FinOps)  
- Observability, monitoring, and operational reliability

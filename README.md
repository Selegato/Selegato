- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer), AWS SAM, Infrastructure as Code  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: FastAPI, Flask, Django
- **Monitoring & Operations**: Dashboards, alarms, logging, cost allocation via tagging  

## Areas of Focus

- Cloud architecture design and infrastructure provisioning  
- Development and optimization of Python-based cloud services  
- Serverless architectures using AWS SAM  
- Cost optimization and financial governance for cloud workloads  
- Observability through metrics, dashboards, and alerts
